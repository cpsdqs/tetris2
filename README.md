# Tetris2
This is a basic tetris* server and client supporting following game modes:

- multiplayer in which the game is run on the server
- multiplayer in which the server only acts as a relay
- local singleplayer

*it resembles tetris enough that most people would call it tetris, but a lot of things probably deviate from the guidelines
